UPnPClient
==========

Android UPnP client, requests some images and shows in a list.

##Some Details
I'm using UPnP to discover a custom UPnP Device, and invoke a service to obtain a list of images, after that I'll request each image using HTTP on port 9000.

You can find the Device (written in Java) [here](https://github.com/dcampogiani/UPnPDesktop).
